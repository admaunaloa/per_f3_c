## ALOHA!
This project is a hardware abstraction (HAL) library for F3 micro-controller peripherals written in C.  
  
The advantages of this libary are:
* Faster execution
* Smaller size
* Interrupt and thread safe register manipulation
* Type safe consistent API interface
* It can co-exist with other HAL libraries

Bitband technology is used extensively and implicit.  
This library gives existing bare-metal projects a performance boost, it unleashes the full power of the peripherals hardware.
